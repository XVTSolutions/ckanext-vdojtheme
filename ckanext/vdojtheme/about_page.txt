The Information Asset Register objectives are:
----------------------------------------------

- To support the use and re-use of information assets by both the department and the public
- To enable information custodians to manage the lifecycle of information assets within their control and to understand its use and importance to the department
- To enable the organisation to track itâ€™s information assets overtime
- To enable the organisation to identify and track risks associated with information assets through improved visibility and explicit custodianship responsibilities.

Information Assets are critical to decision making and service delivery. Like other assets, information needs to be managed, maintained and have its value maximised. By having clear responsibilities for the management of information is core to improving information management outcomes. This reflects in information security, records management and spatial information management policy and practice.
Establishing a register of significant information assets enables;
- Increased information discoverability and sharing
- Identification of unnecessary duplication and
- Identification of assets requiring additional security protection.
